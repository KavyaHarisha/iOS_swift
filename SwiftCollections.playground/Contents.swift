 Swift Arrays:
 An array is a collection of similar types of data. For example,

 Suppose we need to record the age of 5 students. Instead of creating 5 separate variables, we can simply create an array.

 Note:
 It is important to note that, while creating an empty array, we must specify the data type inside the square bracket [] followed by an initializer syntax (). Here, [String]() specifies that the empty array can only store string data elements.
 
 Access Array Elements:
 In Swift, each element in an array is associated with a number. The number is known as an array index.

 We can access elements of an array using the index number (0, 1, 2 â€¦).

 Add Elements to an Array:
 Swift Array provides different methods to add elements to an array.
 1)Using append()
 The append() method adds an element at the end of the array.

 Note: We must use contentOf with append() if we want to add all elements from one array to another.
 2) Using insert():
 The insert() method is used to add elements at the specified position of an array.
 */

/*
 Modify the Elements of an Array:
 We can use the array index to modify the array element.
 */

 Remove an Element from an Array:
 We can use the remove() method to remove the last element from an array.
 */

 Similarly, Array have other methods, below some of those methods are:
 Method                 Description
 removeFirst()          to remove the first element
 removeLast()           to remove the last element
 removeAll()            to remove all elements of an array
 sort()                 sorts array elements
 shuffle()              changes the order of array elements
 forEach()              calls a function for each element
 contains()             searches for the element in an array
 swapAt()               exchanges the position of array                           elements
 reverse()              reverses the order of array elements
 
 Looping Through Array:
 We can use the for loop to iterate over the elements of an array.

/*
 Find Number of Array Elements
 We can use the count property to find the number of elements present in an array.

 Check if an Array is Empty:
 The isEmpty property is used to check if an array is empty or not.
 Here, isEmpty returns:
 true - if the array is empty
 false - if the array is not empty
 */

 Array With Mixed Data Types:
 Till now, we have been using arrays that hold elements of a single data type.

 However, in Swift, we can also create arrays that can hold elements of multiple data types.

 Swift sets:
 A set is a collection of unique data. That is, elements of a set cannot be duplicate.
 */

print("Student id's are \(stundentIds)")
/*
 Note: When you run this code, you might get output in a different order. This is because the set has no particular order.
 
 Add Elements to a Set:
 We use the insert() method to add the specified element to a set.

 Remove an Element from a Set:
 We use the remove() method to remove the specified element from a set.

 Other Set Methods
 Method                     Description
 sorted()                   sorts set elements
 forEach()                  performs the specified actions on                         each element
 contains()                 searches the specified element in                         a set
 randomElement()            returns a random element from the                         set
 firstIndex()               returns the index of the given                            element
 removeFirst()              to remove the first element of a                          set
 removeAll()                to remove all elements of a set
 
 Iterate Over a Set:
 We can use the for loop to iterate over the elements of a set.

 Swift Set Operations:
 Swift Set provides different built-in methods to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, subtraction, and symmetric difference.

 1. Union of Two Sets:

 The intersection of two sets A and B include the common elements between set A and B.

 3. Difference between Two Sets:
 The difference between two sets A and B include elements of set A that are not present on set B.
 */
print("Substraction: ",set1.subtracting(set2))

 4. Symmetric Difference between Two Sets:
 The symmetric difference between two sets A and B includes all elements of A and B without the common elements.

 5. Check Subset of a Set:
 Set B is said to be the subset of set A if all elements of B are also present in A.

 Create an Empty Set:
