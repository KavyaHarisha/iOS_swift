//Write swift comments for single line with double slash symbol

//If you want print any data on console- print
print("Hi to all")

//swift variables
var userName = "John"
//declare variables
var siteName: String // string type
var id: Int  // int type
//assign values to variables
siteName = "google.com"
print(siteName)
// declare variables and assign the value to variables at a time
var carName = "WWW"
print(carName)
//change the value of the variable
carName = "Honda"
print(carName)

//rules for naming swift variables
//--> start with either a letter, an underscore _
var withVar: String
var _withUnderScoreVar: String
//-->Variable names cannot start with numbers and dollar sign $
//-->Swift is case-sensitive. So A and a are different variables
var name = "Apple"
var Name = "banana"
print(name)
print(Name)

//Note:
//-->It's a good practice to give a descriptive variable name.
//-->In Swift, variable names are generally written in camelCase if they have multiple words.
